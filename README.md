# Train-Scheduler
<h1>Set and view train schedules with jQuery and the Firebase API.</h1>

<p>This one-page application uses jQuery and Firebase DB to store and retrieve information so that data is not lost on each page load and so that the user can add information without having to have the page reload.  This app also uses Moments.JS to manipulate time and calculate when trains will be arriving next.</p>

<h2>Other Bonus Features</h2>
<p>Countdown Timer For Wait Time Once A Train Is Selected</p>
<p>A Video Library That Plays Videos Relevant To The Train Selected</p>
<p>A Shuffle Function That Randomly Picks A New Video</p>
<p>An Edit Function So Existing Data Can Be Updated</p>
<p>A Delete Function That Removes All Date For A Train</p>
